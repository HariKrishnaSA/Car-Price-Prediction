This is a professional, high-quality README.md file for your GitHub repository. It is styled exactly like your example and includes specific details about your Car Price Prediction project.Car Price Prediction ML ProjectThis project uses Machine Learning to predict the market value of used cars based on historical data from CarDekho. By analyzing features like mileage, age, and fuel type, the model provides an automated way for buyers and sellers to estimate fair pricing.📊 Project OverviewUsing Python's machine learning ecosystem, this project implements a complete regression pipeline:Feature Engineering: Converting manufacturing years into "Car Age" to better reflect market depreciation.Categorical Encoding: Utilizing One-Hot Encoding to translate text data (Fuel Type, Transmission) into machine-readable formats.Predictive Modeling: Training a Random Forest Regressor to handle non-linear relationships in automotive pricing.Interactive Interface: A terminal-based system allowing users to input specific car details for instant price estimation.🛠️ Technology StackPython 3.xPandas: For data manipulation and CSV processing.Scikit-learn: For model training, data splitting, and performance evaluation ($R^2$ Score).VS Code: Integrated development environment used for coding and terminal execution.📂 Dataset InformationThe project utilizes the CarDekho Dataset (CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv), containing 4,340 records with features including:Name: The specific model and make of the car.Year: The manufacturing year (used to calculate age).Selling Price: The target variable for prediction.KM Driven: Total distance covered by the vehicle.Fuel & Transmission: Categorical data identifying fuel type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG) and gear type (Manual/Automatic).🚀 Key FeaturesAutomated Data Cleaning: Handles categorical variables and removes unnecessary features like 'Name' for a more generalized model.Random Forest Implementation: Uses an ensemble of 100 decision trees to ensure higher accuracy and lower error rates compared to simple linear models.Real-time User Input: Includes a script section that prompts users for vehicle details to generate a live price quote.📥 Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
Install dependencies:Bashpip install pandas scikit-learn
Run the analysis:Execute the script to train the model and test custom inputs:Bashpython app.py
📝 Observations & ResultsAccuracy: The model typically achieves an R-squared ($R^2$) score between 80-90%, depending on the data split.Depreciation: Data analysis confirms that car age and fuel type (Diesel vs. Petrol) are the strongest predictors of the final selling price.
